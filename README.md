# **Simon Game**
<br/>

## Overview

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players are shown a sequence of colored buttons, and they must repeat the sequence in the correct order. As the game progresses, the sequences get longer and harder.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Press any key to start the game.
3. Watch the sequence of colored buttons light up.
4. Repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons on the screen.
5. If you get the sequence right, the game will move to the next level and add another color to the sequence.
6. The game continues until you make a mistake, at which point your score will be displayed, and the game will restart.
